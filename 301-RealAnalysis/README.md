## Lecture-02 (Proof 6.3.1)

We can exchange limit concept with delta-epsilon concept whenever need [22:00-24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qteQ6PdyHWY&list=PLdMfoghed2YIDsRZlN2CfJHuKl4-c5XEo&index=10&t=1518s)

We can give an equivalent alternative formulation for uniform convergence in term of cauchy if the space is (complete) metric space

## [Chain Rule](https://sites.und.edu/timothy.prescott/apex/web/apex.Ch13.S5.html)

Chain Rule is extremely powerful when we do not know what f, g and/or h are. It may be hard to believe, but often in ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù we know rate-of-change information (i.e., information about derivatives) without explicitly knowing the underlying functions. The Chain Rule allows us to combine several rates of change to find another rate of change. The Chain Rule also has theoretic use, giving us insight into the behavior of certain constructions (as we‚Äôll see in the next section).

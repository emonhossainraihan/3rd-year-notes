the theory of algebraic equations, number theory,
and geometry. All three of these areas used group­
theoretic methods of reasoning, although the meth­
ods were considerably more explicit in the first
area than in the other two.

the term order is used in two closely-related senses:

- The order of a group is its cardinality, i.e., the number of its elements
- The order, sometimes period, of an element a of a group is the smallest positive integer such that a^m=e

**Order and structure**: The order of a group and that of an element tend to speak about the structure
of the group. Roughly speaking, the more complicated the factorization of the order the more complicated the group.

> In general, the order of any subgroup of G divides the order of G

**In relation to homomorphisms**: ord(f(a)) divides ord(a)

## Subgroup

- How big are its subgroups?
- How are those subgroups related?
- How many subgroups are there?
- Are any of them normal?

normal subgroup **5Z** + quotient group **Z/5Z** <= subgroup **5Z** <= group **Z**

- Do the cosets form a group?

> To say the cosets form a group means that the elements of this group are the cosets, and the group is the set of all cosets. Hence the new group operation acts on the cosets, not on elements of the cosets, and the result must be another coset. cosets form a group if the **H** normal subgroup exist so.

## Order of Group and Element

- The order of a group is its cardinality, i.e., the number of its elements
- The order, sometimes period, of an element a of a group is the smallest positive integer m such that `a^m = e` (where e denotes the identity element of the group)

- Normal subgroup determine what kinds og homomorphisms are possible from a group G to other groups

## Cycle Structure and Conjugacy

- Permutations can be written as product of cycles
- Cycles with no numbers in common commute
- Cycles with a number in common may not commute
- Cycles can be written in several ways

## SubGroup

I would also argue that studying subgroups is of independent interest. More generally, if I want to understand a class of mathematical structures (groups, rings, topological spaces, linear orderings, ...), then I also want to understand how objects in that class relate to each other: in particular, how can I build new ones from old ones? This question often splits into three sub-questions:

- How can I transform one object into another?
- How can I combine lots of objects into one big object?
- How can I take one object, and "shrink" it to get another object?

Sometimes a lot of information. For example, a finite group is cyclic iff it has one unique subgroup of every order dividing its order, and a group (in general) is solvable iff it has one normal subgroup such that it and the quotient group it determines are solvable...and many other things. Even simpler: in finite groups, the order of a subgroup stricly restricts the possible order of the whole group.

## Fourier series

- Taylor series approximates a complicated function using a series of simpler polynomial functions that are often easier to evaluate. The key idea is to use a series of increasing powers to express complicated yet well-behaved (infinitely differentiable and continuous) functions.
- Unlike Taylor series, a Fourier series can describe functions that are
  not everywhere continuous and/or diﬀerentiable.
- There are also other advantages
  in using trigonometric terms. They are easy to diﬀerentiate and integrate, their
  moduli are easily taken and each term contains only one characteristic frequency.

The particular
conditions that a function f(x) must fulﬁl in order that it may be expanded as a
Fourier series are known as the Dirichlet conditions

- the function must be periodic
- it must be single-valued and continuous, except possibly at a finite number of finite discontinuities
- it must have only a finite number of maxima and minima within one period
- the integral over one period of `|f(x)|` must converge

> All the terms of a Fourier series are mutually orthogonal

> If we wish to ﬁnd the Fourier series of a non-periodic function only within a ﬁxed range then we may continue the function outside the range so as to make it periodic.

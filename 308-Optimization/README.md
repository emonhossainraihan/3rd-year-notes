> In mathematical optimization, a feasible region, feasible set, search space, or solution space is the set of all possible points (sets of values of the choice variables) of an optimization problem that satisfy the problem's constraints, potentially including inequalities, equalities, and integer constraints.

The set of points, or values of the variables, which satisfy the constraints and the non-negativity condition is called the feasible set.

The inequalities Ax ≤ b and x ≥ 0 are the constraints which specify a convex polytope over which the objective function is to be optimized.

### Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming

> If there is a solution to a linear programming problem, then it will occur at a corner point, or on a line segment between two corner points.

### Main Features of the standard form:

- The objective function is of the maximization or minimization type
- All constraints are expressed as equations
- All variables are restricted to be nonnegative
- The right-hand side constant of each constraint is nonnegative

- **Basic Feasible Solution:** A basic solution is called a basic feasible solution if it satisfies the non-negativity restriction.

- **Non-degenerate Basic Feasible Solution:** A basic feasible solution in which all the basic variables are positive is said to be non-degenerate basic feasible solution.

- **Degenerate Basic Feasible Solution:** A basic feasible solution in which one or more basic variables are zero is called a degenerate basic feasible solution.

- **Optimum Solution:** Any basic feasible solution which optimizes the objective function of the general LPP is known as an optimum solution to the LLP.
